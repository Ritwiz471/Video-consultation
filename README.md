What inspired us?

Staying safe is our #1 priority right now. The scenario we are in right now demands the attention of online platforms. Virtual consultations have become extremely important to avoid further Spread of the virus and to reduce the risks of Contracting the virus too.  
 This made us realize that everyone in the clinic including the doctor would be at a risk of turning to be positive. This is how the virus is spreading. Going to the clinic may be avoided but consulting the doctor cannot. Another aspect could be that the patient is too sick to travel to the doctor, an online consultation would help them to be treated from the comfort of their home.
If patients start meeting doctors on online platforms itself, we could reduce the spread of the virus in clinics and hospitals. 
Using this product, even your health would be just a click away.

What technologies did we use?

This is a simple app that uses :

HTML,CSS,JS,BOOTSTRAP for the front-end  & SQL,NODE JS, PHP for the backend.

HTML,CSS and Bootstrap is used for the basic framework of the page as well as for styling the forms which take in information as well as the tables which display the stored data.

All the data entered as a patient and a doctor are stored in databases in SQl and Php is used to communicate the data from the backend to the frontend. i.e to display the available slots, to display the list of doctor's appointments etc.

Once the appointment is confirmed, The doctor and the patient get onto a video call. This uses a technology called "WEBRTC" which is an HTML5 specification that allows you to communicate in real-time directly between browsers without any third-party plugins. To make a remote connection between two or more devices you need a server. In this case, you need a server that handles real-time communication. You know that Node.js is built for real-time scalable applications. To develop two-way connection apps with free data exchange, we use WebSockets that allows opening a communication session between a client and a server. Hence the video call happens.
